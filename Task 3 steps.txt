Step-by-step breakdown of the code:

Import Regular Expression Module and Print Separator:

Import the re module for regular expression operations.
Print a separator line using the print() function and string multiplication.


Define Password Complexity Checker Function:

Define the check_password_complexity function that takes a password as input and evaluates its complexity against predefined criteria.
Define criteria based on password length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters using Boolean expressions and regular expressions.
Provide feedback indicating whether the password meets the complexity criteria. If not, provide specific recommendations on how to improve it.


User Interaction Loop:

Start a while loop to repeatedly ask the user whether they want to enter a new password or quit.
If the user chooses to enter a new password (option == 'n'), enter another loop to ensure the password meets the complexity criteria.
Prompt the user to enter a password and pass it to the check_password_complexity function for evaluation.
Print the feedback returned by the function, indicating whether the password is strong or weak and providing specific recommendations if needed.
If the password is strong, break out of the inner loop.
If the user chooses to quit (option == 'q'), print an exit message and break out of the outer loop.
If the input is neither 'n' nor 'q', print an error message prompting the user to enter a valid option.


Repetitive Input Prompt for Weak Passwords:

If the password is weak, prompt the user to enter a new password until a strong password is provided.


Program Exit:

After the outer loop ends (when the user chooses to quit), print a separator line and exit the program.
Your code effectively guides users through the process of creating a strong password by providing feedback on the complexity criteria. It ensures user interaction and error handling, making it a user-friendly password checker.
